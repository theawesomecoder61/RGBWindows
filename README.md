# RGBWindows
Your PC is probably RGB, so why not make Windows a part of your tricked-out PC?

# Compatibility
- Windows 7 (Aero does not need to be enabled)
- Windows 8
- Windows 8.1
- Windows 10

# How to use
Upon launch, RGB Windows will start cycling the colors immediately.
1. Look in the taskbar for the icon (it looks like the Windows logo).
2. Right-click it and click *Open*.
3. Here, you can adjust the interval for cycling through the colors (30 ms = fast, 300 ms = slow).
